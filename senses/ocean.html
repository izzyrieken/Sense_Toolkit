        <p> I love swimming in the ocean. Most recently I was surfing in big sur on a windy morning. The waves literally blew backward, blowing mist into our frozen faces. Salt water fills all of my senses, but mostly taste. The saltiness was refreshing as I sat in the icy water. It gives me the sense of being overwhelmed by nature. I remember that Iâ€™m in the powerful Pacific ocean and at any moment a wave could come and knock me off my board. But this feeling is also empowering. I love the isolation of being in the ocean and being alone with my thoughts while taking in the most beautiful sights.
