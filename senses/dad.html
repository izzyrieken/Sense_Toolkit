        <p> My dad smells of men’s deodorant and Crest mint toothpaste. It’s a very fresh scent that is sometimes so strong that I will resist being close to him too long. The men’s deodorant has a very masculine scent that is very reminiscent of old spice. The mint toothpaste is so minty it nearly burns my eyes when he leans in for a hug. This smell is very reminiscent of living at home with my parents. Every morning my dad would hug me goodbye before he left to work. This smell not only woke me up every morning, but reminded me of my dad reminding me to “keep my head up” throughout the day.
