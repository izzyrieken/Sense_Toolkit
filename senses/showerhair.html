        <p> The hair on the wall of my shower reminds me of how for years my mom has constantly nagged me to clean my hair up in the shower. She taught me to collect my hair on the wall and throw in the trash after. I used to detest her nagging and would throw a fit every time she came to remind me, but now I am turning into her: always searching the shower drain for stray hairs and often cleaning up after my roommates. It bothers me so much to see hairs lying around.
