        <p> The worst part about walking on ice is how conscious you have to be about how you walk. I find that because the card is so slippery and slick and I take little steps. I've been told it looks like a waddle, but it's worth it because I hate that mini heart attack feeling when you feel yourself slip just a little on the ice..
