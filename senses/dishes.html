        <p> I love cleaning. I like to think that cleaning is one way I like to deal with stress and cope with any anxieties. Once a day I like to do a nice clean of everything in the kitchen and the most gratifying sound is the dishes clanking as I put them away. It's so rewarding because i know i've finished cleaning all the dishes and my job</br> is almost done.
