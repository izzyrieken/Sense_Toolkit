        <p> I’m on the Hudson river looking out the window of this boat. The snow just began falling about 30 minutes ago. I see two geese float by and I think to myself “why are they not freezing”. Then I do a double-take as I realize they each have 2 inches of snow on their backs. I sat and just appreciated this scene for a few minutes. I was so humored to see these two birds just continue about their day with a layer of snow on their backs. This kind of thing doesn’t happen in California.
