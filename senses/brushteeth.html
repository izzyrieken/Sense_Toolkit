        <p> Some nights I get home really late and deliberately don’t brush my teeth. I know it’s horrible, but sometimes I’m just too lazy. But I always suffer the consequences the next morning when I wake up with my mouth tasting like I’ve just eaten cheez-its. By that I mean that there’s a strong aftertaste that is the generic taste of bread or another form of gluten. It’s also sour like the cheese-its aftertaste and leaves me feeling like there’s a strange film over my teeth. I wake up and immediately know I have to brush.
