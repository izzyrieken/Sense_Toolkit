        <p> I rarely nap. When I do though, I hate two things about waking up: feeling groggy and the taste I have in my mouth. I’ve researched, and because a nap is not the full length of your sleep cycle, your body doesn’t produce the saliva that it usually does during sleep to break down your food particles. The body is also breathing less air and so there’s less “ventilation”. Pretty gross. So, this taste is usually a gross reflection of the meals I have usually eaten that day.
