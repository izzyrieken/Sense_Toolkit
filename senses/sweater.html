        <p> I bought this sweater for myself for christmas. The color makes me feel bright, but it comes with the cost of being extremely itchy. The small threads feel plastic like and cling to my bare arms. Within seconds of wearing the sweater on my bare arms I have to take it off because the itch is strong and I canâ€™t focus on anything else.
