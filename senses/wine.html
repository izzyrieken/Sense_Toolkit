        <p> The other night I had to choose a wine and this was the only one I recognized on the shelf. My dad often buys this chardonnay for me at home when I request wine, so I thought “why not”. The flavor is actually very fruity and full, not as sour as other wines. I often prefer sweeter things, so the first flavors are refreshing, however, the after taste is very unique and can only be described as “buttery”. My mouth feels like i’ve just eaten melted butter and therefore I give this strange wine a ⅕ star rating.
