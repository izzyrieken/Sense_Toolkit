        <p> When heated in the microwave for approx. 5 minutes, my hotpack is not only warm, it smells toasty and steamy. The inner-contents that allow for the warmth are beans! When they are heated in the microwave they give off a very nutty aroma that borders smelling of a sweaty person, although not a bad-smelling sweaty person. The smell most reminds me of my mom. She either always has one on her back, or she is always the person that heats up and brings me a hotpack when Iâ€™m not feeling well. I recently</br> brought it with me to New</br> York. The comforting smell</br> reminds me of home and</br> makes me feel cozy in my</br> dorm room.
