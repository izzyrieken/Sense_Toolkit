      <div class = 'kakuni'>

        <p> When I’m stressed I like to cook. The past couple of weeks my comfort dish has been japanese slow roasted pork belly otherwise known as kakuni. The dish takes 6 hours to make, but I love every step of the process. The outcome is a sweet, fatty dish that makes me feel warm from the inside out. When eaten with rice the salty sweetness of the soup binds with the toasty flavor of my rice. It makes me feel like I've eaten dinner and dessert in one meal. There’s not many foods where I can’t hold myself back, but I feel like I could eat kakuni until I explode.
