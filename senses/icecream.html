        <p> The texture on the outside is chewy and warm. Itâ€™s also coated in flour, so i always get a strange coating of white powder around my mouth and on my lips. Biting into the ice cream portion brings a cold sensation to my front teeth and gums. I find it refreshing and love hearing my teeth crush the ice in the ice cream. The ice cream is smooth, but the frozen texture is gratifying.
