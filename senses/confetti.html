        <p> I took a walk down to Chinatown after the parades had ended on Chinese New Year. I was so excited to finish my work and actually see the parade but I had missed it by a few minutes. While fighting the crowds to get into chinatown, I saw the remains of all the confetti poppers lining the dirty, snowy streets. I just love the colors and the reminder of celebration. While it felt slightly unsafe with COVID-19 in the air, seeing bright colors and other visual representations of joy was comforting.
